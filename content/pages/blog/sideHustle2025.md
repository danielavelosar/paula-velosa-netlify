### AI Agent Maker
okay letÂ´s start with the main frog here, AI. What is an ai agent? bassically iterative ai that adjust to get the best outcome. Nowadays, we use an human guidance based iteration but in a future I guess we will have completely independent ai agents. I did a whole post talkig about ways to work in an agentic way.

Anyways, we can optimize a lot of processes just from doing an AI agent maker, being the simplest one client service. But it can be usefull as a trip manager agent, as a personal manager agent. Options are infinite. I really think this is an important step.

I'm gonna make a project with ai agents soon so stay tune

### Enterprise Automatization 

Still in 2025 the major problem is understanding what the client really needs. This is not changing soon so it is a nice gap we can work on. Here im talking about understanding the enterprise, how it works?, WHY it works?, and automatize what needs to be automatize. AI is a powerful tool here, every person in the company can benefit from AI: You can be a consultor for them. However it is more than AI, how the pipeline works, how to connect tools, your job is literally optimizing a company and that will require technical but also business expertise.

### Cibersecurity
Okay vibe coding is here to stay and one of its main threats is how unsecure code can be if it is made by someone who does not really understand what he/she is doing. You know what it means to us? money. Of course vibe coders are not gonna be leading the biggest companies, but employers who dont have enough control of the tools they are using can lead company to have big gaps in their security. Here we take control and we can use all pentesting tools we have to protect everyone data
