While browsing the Internet, I came across several videos of people talking about their side businesses and showing how they achieve economic independence as just teenagers. Taking a step back from my project in data science, I decided to try my hand at building a side hustle on my own. This is a list of possible sources of income I have created based on my research and personal thoughts.

### Before starting

1.  My research's main takeaway is to try to **monetize your portfolio by providing value**. Look out for the brand's issues and solve them using your upcoming skills.

2.  Show your work, write and build a portfolio. It is the easiest way to get money from any  passion you may have

3.  Social media can be monetized!. You could, for example, be a Brand ambassador or try affiliate marketing.

4.  Teach whatever you are good at and monetize it, I'm not sure if this is that easy to do, however, it is mentioned in a number of videos talking about side hustles, so it is worth a shot.  How to teach? Create courses or be a tutor.

5.  Be a freelancer: it is the most obvious one, but it is impossible to ignore as well.

### Web development

1.  Create web pages/apps for local businesses and try to sell them or get a revenue share in return. In [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wWySnxhZYsc), Kalle Hallden calls it "building for free, get paid for life", I find it a pretty good alternative because it may also be a part of your portfolio.

2.  Attempt building your own app or web. This is the hardest one to try but, if you came up with a very good idea, it can be as profitable.

3.  Create templates for components while you are creating your project.

### Data analysis

1.  Analyze brand strategies and reach out to them via social media, you can create a new strategy for them that can take place in your portfolio; however, this is not guaranteed money.

2.  Create templates for visualizing brand strategies.

3.  You can be a consulter for data-driven decisions at local brands.

### Data science

1.  Create a dataset, preprocessing data is hard work, that is why if you develop a dataset that gives value to a brand, you will be able to sell it to them as well.

### Video Games

1.  build your own video game

2.  if you know how to sculpt online, you can create 3d models or templates as well
