As a fullstack developer, Linux is my daily playground. Whether I'm building backend APIs, deploying to a server, or debugging issues in production, the terminal is always open. Here's a list of commands I use all the time ‚Äî plus tips that helped me learn Linux faster.

## üß† Must-Know Linux Commands

### `cd`, `ls`, `pwd`
These are your bread and butter. I use them constantly to move around the filesystem and see where I am.

bash
cd ~/projects/my-app
ls -al
pwd
üí° Tip: Add aliases to your .bashrc or .zshrc for commonly accessed paths.

### grep, find, cat, less
Searching through logs or code? These commands save the day.

bash
grep "error" logs.txt
find . -name "*.js"
cat index.js | less
üí° Tip: Use grep -r "keyword" . to recursively search inside a folder.

### touch, mkdir, rm, mv, cp
For file and folder management. Super useful when creating new files or organizing stuff.

bash
touch test.js
mkdir new-folder
rm -rf node_modules/
mv index.html public/
cp .env.example .env
‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful with rm -rf. Double-check before pressing Enter!

### curl, wget
Great for testing APIs or downloading stuff directly from a URL.

bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/status
wget https://someurl.com/file.zip
üí° Tip: Use curl -I to see only the response headers.

### chmod, chown
Useful for setting permissions when something‚Äôs not working right.

bash
chmod +x deploy.sh
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER ./my-project
üí° Tip: chmod +x makes a script executable.

### top, htop, ps, kill
For checking what‚Äôs eating up your CPU or killing processes.

bash
top
ps aux | grep node
kill -9 PID

### docker, docker-compose
If you're running services locally, Docker is essential (a lit nightmare at first tho but let's make it simple).

bash
docker-compose up -d
docker ps
docker logs -f container_name
üí° Tip: Use .env files with Docker Compose to make configs cleaner.
