it has been a while since i decided to start data science journey, i reckon i´ve learned the minimum enough to get started with my own project. I wish i was able to do it before because, from what i´ve found, a project is the best way possible to keep on track what you actually have learnt, i guess i´ll just see by myself if that´s true or not.

When you start everything comes down to a question: What am i gonna do? is this idea too much?, is it enough? For me, the best way possible to cope with that was simply not to think about it. I found a twitter thread from svino where he talks about several ml projects (im gonna leave it down below) and i just picked the one which came to me the most: Music player. However, i thought that podcasts will be a little bit more challenging so it came to be a Podcast player 

This is my first step, i´m merely a beginer and that´s why i will document my journey from that perspective.

In the same threat, Alejandro (svino) talks about a really interesting aproach: try to divide your project into the features. Later, try to find the easiest way possible to accomplish every single one 

That´s why i orginized myself as such:
1. it has to have an inteface
2. need something to decide what podcast to recommend
3. the program will take you to the spotify link


As my first aproac , i think i will use simple html css and js for create the interface.
i found as well a dataset from kaggle about podcast reviews and i think i will go on with a classifier on whether people like it or not
