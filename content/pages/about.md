Hi! I'm an engineering student who likes design, data science, and web development.

Since I was little, I have loved working in multiple fields with one thing in common: technology. That's why I have aimed my time at learning whatever I could from this field. Leveraging connections created for problem-solving.

Do you want to work together? I'd be happy to talk with you by email or social media!.

*Thank You for reading!*

Pd. In my free time, I love art, [this](https://www.behance.net/paulavelosa) is my portfolio if you want to check it out!
